## üìù Overview

This repository contains the code and instructions for preparing the input data for the *Parsimonious Dryland Water Partition* model - [**`DRYP`**](https://github.com/n-ivanovic/DRYP). The DRYP model is a hydrological model that simulates the water balance of a catchment, including the processes of precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff, and groundwater flow. The model requires a range of input data, including terrain, surface, soil, and subsurface data, as well as groundwater and boundary conditions.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- [`/0_terrain_data`](https://github.com/n-ivanovic/DRYP_input_preparation/tree/Main/0_terrain_data): Contains the code and instructions for preparing terrain data.
- [`/1_surface_data`](https://github.com/n-ivanovic/DRYP_input_preparation/tree/Main/1_surface_data): Contains the code and instructions for preparing surface data.
- [`/2_soil_and_subsurface_data`](https://github.com/n-ivanovic/DRYP_input_preparation/tree/Main/2_soil_and_subsurface_data): Contains the code and instructions for preparing soil and subsurface data.
- [`/3_groundwater_and_boundary_conditions_data`](https://github.com/n-ivanovic/DRYP_input_preparation/tree/Main/3_groundwater_and_boundary_conditions_data): Contains the code and instructions for preparing groundwater and boundary conditions data.

### Terrain Data Preparation

- **Input:** DEM and UPSTREAM tiles from [MERIT Hydro](https://hydro.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~yamadai/MERIT_Hydro/).
- **Operations:** Download, merge, reproject/resample, and calculate terrain parameters.
- **Outputs:** DEM, cell area, flow direction, (CHB) boundary conditions, terrain mask, river lengths.

### Surface Data Preparation

- In development.

### Soil and Subsurface Data Preparation

- **Input:** Soil data from [HiHydroSoil_v2.0](https://www.futurewater.eu/projects/hihydrosoil/) with following [layers](https://gee-community-catalog.org/projects/hihydro_soil/), and soil depth from [ISRIC](https://www.isric.org/explore/soilgrids).
- **Operations:** Download and process soil data.
- **Outputs:** Soil porosity, residual theta, AWC, wilting point, soil depth, particle distribution parameter, soil suction head, Ksat, sigma Ksat.

### Groundwater and Boundary Conditions Data Preparation

- **Input:** Aquifer Ksat from [GLHYMPS](https://borealisdata.ca/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.5683/SP2/TTJNIU), water table depth from [G¬≥M 1.0](https://zenodo.org/records/1315471, ) [DOI](https://gmd.copernicus.org/preprints/gmd-2018-120/gmd-2018-120.pdf).
- **Operations:** Download and process groundwater data.
- **Outputs:** Aquifer Ksat, specific yield, WTE, (CHB) boundary conditions.
